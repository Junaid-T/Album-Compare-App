A small app that I made, that me and a few friends use, where you can rank songs from various albums and get an overall "score" of each one, and thus which album(s) you think are better on average.
Can include any number of albums and I included a weighting system, so the final score is not affected by the length. Just on the average ranking of it's respective songs.

Made in React with React Beautiful DnD to deal with the "drag and drop" functionality
